# Beem Billboard Route Optimizer

## How to Run the App

**Important**: Always use the `app_code.py` file to run the application, not `app.py`:

```bash
# Option 1: Run directly
streamlit run app_code.py

# Option 2: Use the provided script
./run_app.sh

# Option 3: If the app gets stuck, use the restart script
./restart_app.sh
```

If you encounter any issues with the app not showing the latest changes, make sure you're running the correct file and try using the restart script.
